# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description 

This week I was challenged with creating a quiz with JavaScript, and containing JavaScript questions.

While creating my site, I found challenges around every corner, but found that Google is a great friend, and so is my lovely tutor, Kelly!

Overall this was a difficult project, but one that was fun to show off once finished with.
